## Welcome! 👋

Hi, I’m Oleksii — thanks for visiting my GitHub.

Over the past 7 years, I have worked as a Frontend Developer for major product companies, where most of my work was done in closed-source environments.  
As a result, my public GitHub presence is relatively new.

Currently, I am in a creative search for new opportunities.  
To demonstrate my real-world frontend skills and passion for modern technologies, I built a full project from scratch using **Nuxt 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Pinia**, and other up-to-date tools.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
